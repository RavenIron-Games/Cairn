    /// Makes a cairn affordable by rewriting `stone_pile`'s stone cost.
    ///
    /// THIS IS A BALANCE CHANGE TO A VANILLA PIECE, and it is the one thing in this mod that
    /// reaches outside its own scope. Recorded plainly because it was argued against and
    /// then decided: at vanilla's 50 stone a piece, a two-pile cairn costs 100 stone, which
    /// is enough that nobody builds waymarks casually — and a navigation mod whose waymarks
    /// are too expensive to litter has failed at the only thing it does. RavenIron's call,
    /// 2026-09-02, over a recorded objection that `stone_pile` is not our prefab and people
    /// build them for decoration too.
    ///
    /// Two things keep it honest. `StonePileStoneCost = 0` leaves vanilla entirely alone. And
    /// the change announces itself at boot with the before and after, because a mod that
    /// silently halves a recipe is exactly the kind of surprise this studio complains about
    /// in others.
    ///
    /// IT IS PER PLAYER. Build cost is checked and consumed on the building player's own
    /// client, against the prefab in their own ZNetScene, and config is not synced. So the
    /// value in effect is whatever each player set; a dedicated server's own setting changes
    /// nothing for anyone (review finding 4, 2026-09-24 — documented, not synced).
    ///
    /// Applied from a ZNetScene.Awake postfix: prefabs do not exist before that, and the
    /// Piece component's requirement array is shared prefab data, so one write covers every
    /// placement afterwards.
