    /// 1. Every system gets its own on/off toggle from day one. That is what makes
    ///    incremental testing possible and lets a server owner adopt part of the mod.
    ///    There are no systems yet, so there are no system toggles yet — a toggle for a
    ///    thing that does not exist is a promise the log cannot keep.

    /// 2. Clamp on READ as well as on write. Config files get hand-edited, and BepInEx
    ///    persists whatever it clamped, so a value validated only on write comes back
    ///    wrong on the next boot.
