    ///   • It despawns during `RandEventSystem.InEvent()` — so a Ragnarok's Wrath storm
    ///     silences it at the moment you would most want a landmark named.
    ///
    /// A navigation channel cannot be built on that. A grace note can. So this offers a line
    /// and lets vanilla decide whether the bird ever shows up; when it does not, nothing is
    /// lost and nothing is logged as wrong.
